# Flashcards

## What are Flashcards?

Flashcards are a tool used for organizing information, learning, and memorization. Flashcards usually consist of a question (or term) and an answer (or definition). This version of Flashcards also has a third side with the option to display an expanded answer with additional explanations. However, if you don't need the expanded answer, you can choose not to use it.

Flashcards are commonly used in studying for exams or learning new theoretical material, as they can help with recalling important information quickly and efficiently. 

## How to use the app?

You can use the search to find a card. Currently, the search is performed by matching part of the question.

You can view questions of public cards. But to view the card completely or create a new one and use the study mode, you should register.

## Registration

To register, you need to enter an email and a password. If desired, you can add a first and last name. The details can be changed on the Edit Profile page.

## How organized is the Flashcards app?

The cards are arranged in sets. Folders are used to systematize sets.

Here you can see all cards in the set:

Here you can see all sets in the folder:

And also, here you can see all your folders:

Card sets can be viewed in study mode. For it go to needed set. To do this, go to the required set and the Learn page

You can go through a question-answer-extended answer and go to the next or previous card:

## Operation with card/set/folder

You can do standard operations with cards/sets/folders: create, read, update, and delete.
Creation by "+" and viewing are covered above. In this way, you can create not only cards, but also sets and folders.

### Create

Also, you can create new cards from the current set. The name of the set and folder will be entered, but can be changed as desired. When changing the name of a set/folder for a card, these names in the set/folder will not be changed, but a new set/folder with the specified name will be created (this rule also applies to editing).

In the same way, you can create new sets in folders:

### Edit and delete

To delete or edit, go to the required card/set/folder and select what you want to do

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110383852/233298359-7a01a079-1116-439c-b88a-883d5ad6840d.png)

You must save your changes or confirm the deletion:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110383852/233300536-b54e3cbb-5e43-4ae3-895e-6fad56dbf3ce.png)

If you delete a set, all cards in the set will be deleted! If you delete a folder, everything in the folder will be deleted!

### Move between sets/folders

Cards/sets can be moved to another set/folder. To do this, open the —Åard/set for editing and specify the name of the set/folder to which it should be moved. If a folder/set with such names already exists, the card/set will be moved there. If these do not exist, a new folder/set with such names will be created.

Let's try to move one of the cards to a new folder:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110383852/233308950-0708aed1-29aa-48d8-8cda-0c7a170f74b2.png)

Go to the card and click Edit

Change the name of the folder and save the changes:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110383852/233309558-e229cf67-a2dc-46dd-a22f-0858b24a0fdb.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110383852/233309564-c8ee8d82-13d2-49ca-9319-381062d5998f.png)

After going to view all your folders, you will see that a new folder has been created:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110383852/233311323-6537c24b-ef33-4fc2-8d4c-b7603a4add78.png)

A set with the same name was created in the new folder and the card moved here:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110383852/233310391-523a0380-bd42-40a4-8950-788109fda1a9.png)

In the old set, the card that was edited disappeared:

## Administrator

The web application has an administrator who can view general information about users. Here you can search for users by matching part of the name or surname. You can open all information about the user.

In the user card, it can be blocked or unblocked.

The administrator can assign others as administrators, or remove this ability.
